## Hey there 👋

I build Android apps with Kotlin. Used to do web development — made websites with JavaScript and Next.js, but then switched to mobile and now I'm diving deeper into Android.

```What I do```

Mostly working on mobile products — from idea to release. Writing code, thinking through architecture. I like it when an app not only works but is actually pleasant to use.

For now, I'm mostly working with classic Views, but gradually moving to Jetpack Compose — love how it simplifies UI work. When it comes to architecture patterns, I prefer MVVM and Clean Architecture, but without being dogmatic about it — the main thing is that the code stays readable.

```Tech stack```

**Currently working with:**  
Kotlin, Android SDK, Retrofit, Сoroutines, Material3, sometimes Jetpack Compose, and other technologies related to Android development

**Have experience with:**  
JavaScript, React, Next.js — started with web development, but now fully focused on Android

```What interests me```

I'm drawn to tasks where you need to think about performance or come up with a non-standard solution. Also love digging into documentation and figuring out how things work under the hood.
